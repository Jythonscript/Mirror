# Mirror
A program written in C that horizontally inverts every line from standard input
## TODO
* Use heap to allocate memory instead of using recursion, which is on the stack
* Use getopts for argument parsing
* Add flag for inverting characters that have an inverted counterpart. Eg: (, [, {, <, /
* Add flag for keeping colors when inverting
